# AI ML Football Analysis System

This project is from a challenge of Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout/data?select=clips

I have used YOLO library to detect players, referees and ball. I have applied the knowledge about KMeans and clustering that I obtained from my Data Mining class at INSA de Rennes to assign players to team from their shirt. And finally, I have succeeded in calculating speed and the distance.

To run this project, it requires: Python 3.x, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pytorch, ultralytics and supervison.
